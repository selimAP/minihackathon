# MovieGuesser

MovieGuesser is a fun web game inspired by the "Higher or Lower" mechanics, where players must guess which of two movies has won more awards. The game uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movie data.

**Note:** The API might be slow, or there could be problems with the code implementation. This might lead to delays or unexpected behavior.

- **Awards Info:** The number of awards for each movie is only revealed after the guess to add to the challenge.
